Uh oh! You check every drawer and spot in your 
home, but come to one realization: you are OUT 
OF MONEY. With rent coming soon, and taxes only 
rising, you realize that you have to return 
back to Britain. You simply canâ€™t afford to 
live here any longer. Head hung low, you return 
home, and read about the events in America as 
opposed to experiencing them firsthand.
